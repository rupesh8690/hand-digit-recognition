**Handwritten Digit Recognizer (Neural Network using MNIST)**
---
A simple Tkinter GUI-based digit recognizer built with TensorFlow (Keras) that lets you draw digits (0–9) and predicts them using a trained Neural Network on the MNIST dataset.

**Features**

- Draw any digit (0–9) on a canvas.

- Predict the digit with confidence score.

- Clear and redraw easily.

- View model training and testing accuracy.

- Automatically trains and saves the model if not found locally.

**Tech Stack**
- Python 3.8+

- TensorFlow / Keras

- Tkinter (GUI)

- Pillow (Image Processing)

- NumPy

**Setup Instruction**
